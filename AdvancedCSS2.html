      <p> I'm heading back to Colorado tomorrow after being down in Santa
        Barbara over the weekend for the festival there. I will be making October
        plans once there and will try to arrange so I'm back here for the birthday
        if possible. I'll let you know as soon as I know the doctor's appointment
        schedule and my flight plans.</p>
