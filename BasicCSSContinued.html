<p class="textright">There are different types of secrets.
  She had held onto plenty of them during her life, but this one was different.
  She found herself holding onto the worst type.
  It was the type of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didn't tell someone about it,
  but it could end up getting you killed if you did.</p>

<p class="textleft">It was a weird concept. Why would I really need to generate a random paragraph?
Could I actually learn something from doing so? All these questions were running through her
head as she pressed the generate button. To her surprise, she found what she least
expected to see.</p>
<p class="textcenter">There was something beautiful in his hate. It wasn't the hate itself as it was a disgusting
display of racism and intolerance. It was what propelled the hate and the fact that although he
had this hate, he didn't understand where it came from. It was at that moment that she realized
that there was hope in changing him. Dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill, only a few miles from her house.
The car had been hastily packed and Marta was inside trying to round up the last of the pets.
Dave went through his mental list of the most important papers and documents that they couldn't leave behind.
He scolded himself for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was needed.
He continued to wait for Marta to appear with the pets, but she still was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p class="textjustify">Do you really listen when you are talking with someone?
  I have a friend who listens in an unforgiving way. She actually takes every word you say
  as being something important and when you have a friend that listens like that, words take
  on a whole new meaning.</p>

<p class="textspace">They rushed out the door, grabbing anything and everything they could think of
  they might need. There was no time to double-check to make sure they weren't leaving something
  important behind. Everything was thrown into the car and they sped off. Thirty minutes later
  they were safe and that was when it dawned on them that they had forgotten the most important
  thing of all.</p>
<p class="textheight">She didn't understand how changed worked. When she looked at today compared to
  yesterday, there was nothing that she could see that was different. Yet, when she looked at
  today compared to last year, she couldn't see how anything was ever the same.</p>
